# AgLoadMonitor 🚜📊

**Open Source Feed Loading Assistant powered by Computer Vision**

AgLoadMonitor is an open-source solution designed to digitize and simplify the feeding process on the farm. By using a Raspberry Pi and a custom-trained **YOLO (Ultralytics)** model, this system reads the weight display of your feed mixer or block wagon via a standard ip-camera and streams the data directly to your smartphone or tablet.

No expensive proprietary hardware upgrades needed—just smart software and off-the-shelf components.

## 🧠 How it Works

### 1. The Vision Pipeline (YOLO)
Instead of standard OCR (which struggles with digital screens in sunlight), we use a custom-trained **Ultralytics YOLO model**.
* **Detection:** The model detects individual digits on the screen.
* **Logic:** `[1] + [2] + [3] + [0]` detected → Parsed as `1230 kg`.
* **Stream Optimization:** To reduce latency on the local network, the web interface leverages the JavaScript framework JSMpeg.

**OpenDataset:** for this project the dataset where is trained on is available at https://universe.roboflow.com/projects-4essy/feedload-monitors

### 2. The Data Flow
1.  **Startup:** Tractor starts → Pi Boots → Connects to Camera.
2.  **Loading:** User selects a Feed Plan on the phone.
3.  **Monitoring:** * Camera watches the scale.
    * YOLO parses the numbers.
    * App calculates "Remaining to load".
4.  **Completion:** User finishes loading.
5.  **Shutdown/Sync:** Pi connects to Farm WiFi → Uploads `logs.json` → Downloads updated `plans.json`.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Functionality
* **Real-time Weight Digitization:** Uses Computer Vision to read the 7-segment display of your existing weighing scale.
* **Digital Feed Plans:** Manage recipes (Grass, Maize, Meal, etc.) via a web interface.
* **Target Visualization:** Progress bars turn from **Red** to **Green** as you approach the target weight.
* **Quick Adjustments:** Buttons to instantly adjust the total feed amount by ±10% or ±20% based on herd appetite.

### Smart Logic (The "Easy" Factor)
* **🔄 Auto-Tare:** The software detects when the screen jumps to `0` and automatically switches to the next component in the feed plan.
* **⚖️ Stability Check:** The system waits for the weight to remain stable for **3 seconds** before logging the data, preventing false readings from a shaking wagon.
* **📸 Visual Audit Log:** Saves a low-res screenshot of the physical scale for every loaded component. (e.g., *"The system logged 1230kg, and here is the photo of the screen proving it."*)

### Connectivity & Sync
* **Offline-First Architecture:** The Raspberry Pi acts as a local server. You connect your phone directly to it in the tractor—no internet required to feed.
* **Smart Cloud Sync:** When the tractor is turned off (or returns to the farm yard), the Pi detects the home WiFi and pushes JSON logs to a cloud location (GitHub/Dropbox/Private Server). This ensures feed plans can be edited in the office and downloaded automatically the next morning.

## 🛠 Hardware Setup

1.  **Compute:** Jetson Nano acting as the local web server and Image processor.
    * *Power:* Connected to the tractor's 12V ignition (boots on start).
2.  **Vision:** Standard IP Camera.
    * *Mounting:* Directed at the weighing monitor.
    * *Optional:* Secondary camera inside the mixing tub (future feature).
3.  **Client:** Any smartphone, tablet, or laptop (via Browser).

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10
* Ultralytics (`pip install ultralytics`)
* Flask (for the web server)
* OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`, includes the FFmpeg backend for RTSP)
* **The frontend is Built with Svelte/Vite.

> Note: go2rtc and a separate FFmpeg install are no longer required. Camera feeds are decoded by OpenCV and served directly as MJPEG by Flask, so the app ships as a single self-contained executable (Windows & Linux).

### Running the Server
```bash
# Check the ultralytics docs for booting the Jetson and installing the Embedded Cuda
https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/#detailed-comparison-tables 

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JacobsFarm/AgLoadmonitor.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py

Accessing the Interface

    Connect your phone to the Jetson's WiFi Hotspot.

    The app starts on port 5001 and opens the browser automatically on the device.

    Navigate to http://192.168.x.x:5001 in your browser (chrome most stabile)

    http://192.168.x.x:5001/video_feed_ocr  #feedmonitor camera with yolo prediction
    http://192.168.x.x:5001/video_feed_cam1 #Camera 1 feed (MJPEG)
    http://192.168.x.x:5001/video_feed_cam2 #Camera 2 feed (MJPEG)

Locally on the device (http://localhost:5001) latency is lowest; over the network it lags slightly more.
```

For the jetson

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg


## 🗺 Roadmap & Challenges

- [x] **Browser Camera Integration:** Basic camera functionality operational in the browser.
- [x] **Automated Weight Reading:** Implement digit recognition using [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
- [x] **Stream handling:** Cameras served as MJPEG directly from OpenCV/Flask (go2rtc removed for single-binary builds)
- [x] **Better webapp:** Restructure to use the Svelte compiler
- [ ] **configuration:** Extra tabs for configuration, uploading feed plans, history
- [ ] **Feed Plan Logic:** Develop progress tracking, dynamic component switching, and visual feedback.
- [ ] **Feed Type Classification:** Auto-detect feed type (e.g., Grass vs. Maize) via internal camera to adjust the plan automatically.
- [ ] **start over:** The created technical debt is unsustainable, burn the the existing repo, re-engineer the system with a architecture that makes sense
- [ ] **Production Architecture:** Further Optimize for performance, security, fault tolerance, and simplify the installation/upgrade process.
- [ ] **Deployment** share ready webapp with server acces for saving feedplans and logs
